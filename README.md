Developer Challenges for Exelia


## 1. JavaScript Test

I built 2 versions of the this test:

I was not sure if the single page application meant only using one html page or if it was limited to a SPA.
- jQuery version (single page)
- React version (SPA).

### jQueryVersion

location: **1-javascript-test-jquery/**
### React Version
location:4-web-based-backend **1-javascript-test-react/**

All custom environment variables can be found in the .env file

I installed Material UI for a very modern style - [https://mui.com/](https://mui.com/)

This test took approximately 5 hours for both of the tests.

## 2. C# test and algorithm skills
location: **2-algorithm-test/**

A very simple class using three main methods to validate the sudoku puzzle.
Simply add the project to visual studio 2019 and run **Program.cs**.

This test took approximately 3 and a half hours.

## 4. C# or JavaScript test for web based back-end

location: **4-web-based-backend**

I skipped three and decided to tackle the WEB API instead.
I had a lot of difficulty with this one not going to lie. :')

It was amazing learning about dependency injection with C#

I'm sadly not very familiar with this but I would jump at the opportunity to get to learn it even more.

This test took approximately 6 hours and counting...
